#### The Mindful Way

Living life, the mindful way <br>
It is always now, as they say

From moment to moment, each moment at a time<br>
Life is its own meaning, it’s not like a dime

The bias in our minds, creates the confusion<br>
Dropping this bias, is a clear solution

Act for the action, not the results that you seek<br>
It’s the seeking in life, that makes the mind weak

Compassion, kindness and love are their own results<br>
To understand this message, we don’t need cults

When we say I am this, it means we’re not that<br>
After all we realise, beliefs are a bit like scat

It’s a story that we hold very close to our heart<br>
Until one day it’s researched and defied by a chart

Presence in the present requires no belief<br>
Dropping all the notions leaves a sigh of relief

What is it that is different in us from the others<br>
Striving for uniqueness is the thought that really bothers

We’re all so unique and yet we’re all the same<br>
Different characters as it may seem, we’re all in the same game

It’s a skill to cherish life, in this moment as it is<br>
It’s as simple as it sounds, you don’t need to be a whiz
