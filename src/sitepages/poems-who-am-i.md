## Who am I?


Who am I, I frequently wonder<br>
Am I this mind that’s constantly on wander

Am I the thought that drives me to action?<br>
Or are all these thoughts a mere distraction?

Am I the result of the actions I performed<br>
Or am I an osmosis of people that got me transformed?

Am I the name, that I didn't even choose?<br>
It sounds like a reflection of my family's views

Am I this body, that's made of food?<br>
It's just a form of matter, one shall conclude

Am I a combination of the roles that I play?<br>
Or am I a reflection of the words that I say?

Am I a soul that witnesses my world?<br>
Or is that a story to get me whirled?

Am I a result of the exposure I’ve had<br>
I wonder if my identity is just a fad?

How am I different from a computer that learns<br>
Which may soon evolve to have its yearns

Am I a summation of choices that I’ve made<br>
Am I really choosing or am I getting swayed

Science and philosophy seem to have a common theme<br>
Amidst all the doubts, there seems to be a gleam

Whilst there are questions about the soul<br>
I’m a part of the whole and the whole
