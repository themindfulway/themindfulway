## What if I die tonight?


What if I die tonight..<br>
Will it be a joy, sorrow or delight..

And does it really matter, whether I am or I am not..<br>
Coz all this world, just seems to be a plot!

Would the earth stop moving and the Sun stop shining ..<br>
Would the stars stop twinkling and the wind stop rhyming..

Would the men stop doing their daily chores..<br>
Would the water stop splashing on sea shores..

If nothing in this world is gonna change at all..<br>
Then why on earth are we afraid to fall ..?

Then some would come to say good bye..<br>
But I wont be there to see them sigh!

And some would remember in their silent tears..<br>
In memories of those wonderful years..

For the world that night might be sad..<br>
But deep inside I will be glad..

Coz I'm gonna see the truth that night..<br>
After all this wait, I'm gonna see that light!
