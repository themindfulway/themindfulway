Having worked in the Data &#x26; AI space for a good part of my life, the way I see this is that they are simply our brain child; They will do what we teach them. They are not very different from our kids. Our future generations can be equally favourable or unfavourable to our society based on what we teach them. Here's a short poem that summarises this idea:</p>\n<p>Computers are mindful, they won’t intentionally hurt<br>\nThey’ll tell us the truth though, as they don’t skirt</p>\n<p>They’re peaceful and calm, whatever we throw at them<br>\nUnless we ask them to, they won’t even care for a gem</p>\n<p>They will do and say exactly what we teach them<br>\nThey won’t alter their views even if we preach them</p>\n<p>They will show bias if that is what they learn<br>\nIt’s not because they have a desire or because they yearn</p>\n<p>The intelligence in them is an extension of our mind<br>\nThey equanimously tell us, whatever they find</p>\n<p>They don’t have senses to seek gratification<br>\nThey don’t have an ego to  cause fixation</p>\n<p>No goals bind them, there are no aspirations<br>\nNo journey will make them happy, they are content at the station</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 30, 2020","slug":"/poems/computers-are-mindful","title":"Computers are Mindful"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/poems/computers-are-mindful"}}}
